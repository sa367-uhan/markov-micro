    "The Markov Micromanufacturing Company has 9 production jobs it needs to process in the next 24 hours. The company has 4 identical machines that run in parallel. Each of these 9 jobs must be run on one of these machines nonpreemptively: that is, once a job is started on a machine, it must stay on that machine until it is completed. The processing times of these jobs are given below:\n",
